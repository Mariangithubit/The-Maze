The Maze 

Introduction
  The 3D-Maze Solver project aimed to look at how it is possible to do a game without a game engine and develop an interactive maze-solving application using SDL2, offering a combination of entertainment and algorithmic challenges.

sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

Usage
The Maze is 3D game built using SDL and Raycasting. On the map, the player can move in all four directions using keys W, A, S, and D.

The player can move through the maze and turn left or right as desired.

If the player hits a wall, they cannot move unless they change their direction.

The player can move on several directions and rotate in the same time.

W - Moving forward

S - Moving backward

A - Look left

D - Look right

Mouse move left/right - look left or right

M - Turn off map visibility. The 2D map won't be visible on clicking

N - Turn on map visibility. The 2D map will be visible again if it wasn't

Have fun!
